# In python, avoid multiple inheritance altogether. Diamond inheritance of parent object state and 
# constructor ordering are error prone.

# In most cases, the need of the convenience and encapsulation that comes with multiple inheritance 
# can be met by writing a mix-in.
# A mix-in is a class that only defines a set of additional methods that a class should provide. Mix-in 
# classes donâ€™t define their own instance attributes nor require their __init__ constructor to be called.

# Writing mix-ins is easy in Python as it inspects the current state of any object regardless of its type. 
# Dynamic inspection enables writing generic functionality a single time, in a mix-in, that can be applied 
# to many other classes. Mix-ins is the best solution for modular reuse.

# Generator functions simply return objects with methods that handle next operations run by for loops
# at each level, and donâ€™t produce any results until iterated.
# In other words, generator provide memory efficient way of iteration, esp for long sequences, such as
# big datasets and large files.

# Since generator functions retain their local scope state while active, it minimizes memory space requirements,
# and divides the work into shorter time slices.
